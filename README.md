# birthdate_palindrome
A palindrome is a word/number which reads the same backward as forward
This app checks your birthdate in 4 formats dd-mm-yyyy, mm-dd-yyyy, mm-dd-yy and dd-mm-yy
For eg. Your Date of birth is 14-sep-1998. We will check for 14091998, 09141998, 091498 and 140998
If these 4 formats are not palindrome then we will suggest the next neareast palindrome date from your DOB
